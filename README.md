Everyone of Git.  I am Reinald Portee, LeonXpX.  For a very short period of time I was honored and privilege to aquire a group that repects the reason why many of us are here and able to have a platform to socialize, learn and even work.  Being so new and taking on something, which I consider so major I carried with a lot of pride while at the same time it pushed me to work even harder.

Unforuntely, through a strange contact from GitHub, I obtained this account and then I found this account multiplying on my home DevDrive.  Only files I keep on this particualar drive are codes from GitHub and to this very moment, that's all that remains dedicatd to that drive.  Unforuntately at the moment this account seemed to have been the only one effect.  In stead of risking it somehow getting to one of you and messing up your computer.  I was luckly enough to have stopped it (knock on wood)  As far as I can tell.  However, I am running more test and on my system and making sure it is secure before attaching this account back to the drive it is dedicated to.  

To the rest of the memebers, if you are on any of my other repositories, as far as I know and I've been actively on top of this.  This is the only account I've seen effected.  I will keep you up to date and I had to announce horrible knews knowing how much we have all worked towards this project.  It was placed in my care and I refuse to have anyone suffer over something I didn't fight to keep safe.

I hope everyone you'll be patience with me as I'm having this issues being monitored and maintained.  I am working very hard to make sure everyone's business remains safe and I assure you I'll have this account back up and running as soon as possible, that I promise.

If you have any questions or concerns please contact myself or the support at [https://support.github.com/ GitHub.com].  Again I apaologize for the inconvience and I ask you bare with me as this problem is fixed.
